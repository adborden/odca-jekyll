Conductive energy devices (“CEDs”) are weapons that discharge electrical currents into an
individual, causing incapacitation. CEDs are sometimes referred to as tasers. Taser is a brand
name of one type of CED.

San Francisco police officers do not currently use CEDs.

The San Francisco Police Commission (“Commission”) sets policy for the San Francisco Police
Department (“SFPD”). In November 2017, the Commission authorized the SFPD to use CEDs
starting in December 2018.

Automated External Defibrillators (“AED”s) are portable devices that deliver an electric shock to
the heart, and can allow a normal rhythm to resume following sudden cardiac arrest. About half
of SFPD patrol vehicles have AEDs.

The City’s Charter establishes the City’s budget process. Under that process, the Board of
Supervisors and the Mayor must approve the City’s budget each year.

This measure would authorize the SFPD to purchase CEDs for each police officer. This measure
would authorize officers to use CEDs, subject to the following conditions:

- only officers who have successfully completed certain training would be authorized to use CEDs;
- officers could only use SFPD-issued CEDs and holsters;
- officers would be required to carry their CEDs in holsters on the opposite side of their body from their firearm;
- SFPD vehicles in police districts where CEDs are deployed would be required to carry AEDs;
- the SFPD would be required to conduct an investigation each time an officer used a CED.

This measure would require the SFPD to request that the City appropriate sufficient funds each
year to implement this measure. The SFPD would have to make the first request for
appropriation of funds 45 days after this measure is enacted.
