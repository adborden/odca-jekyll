Under the proposed Charter amendment, appointed members of boards and commissions
under the Charter would forfeit their offices upon filing a declaration of candidacy for state or
local elective office. The measure would not apply to elective officers, even those who have
been appointed to a board or commission like the Retirement Board or the Health Service
Board. The measure also would not apply to elected members of the Retirement Board,
Health Service Board, or Retiree Healthcare Trust Fund Board. And the measure would not
apply to members of citizen advisory committees.
