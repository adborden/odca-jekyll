This amendment would allow the PUC to also issue revenue bonds for power facilities, when
approved by a 2/3 vote of the Board of Supervisors. Bonds issued for power facilities would
be subject to all of the other requirements of Section 8B.124 that currently apply to the PUC's
water and clean water utility enterprises. PUC would be prohibited from financing
construction of power plants that generate electricity using fossil fuels.
The Third Draft would amend the Charter to clarify that the PUC's authority to issue revenue
bonds for water, clean water, and/or power facilities includes the authority to issue bonds for
any lawful purpose of those three utilities.
