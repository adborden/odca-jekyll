The City’s professional sports teams include the San Francisco Giants baseball team. The San
Francisco 49ers football team plays its home games in Santa Clara.

The Golden State Warriors basketball team currently plays its home games in Oakland, but will
start playing its home games in San Francisco when the Chase Center, a multi-purpose arena
under construction in San Francisco’s Mission Bay neighborhood, is completed.

This measure would adopt a policy providing that the City will not invite, entice, encourage,
cajole, or condone the relocation of any professional sports team that has previously established
itself in another municipality and has demonstrated clear and convincing support from
community and fans for at least 20 years and is profitable. This measure would also adopt a
policy that against any sports team ownership group that attempts to avoid payment of an
outstanding public debt.
