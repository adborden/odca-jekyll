The proposed ordinance amends the Health Code to prohibit local tobacco retailers from
selling flavored tobacco products. The tobacco products that would be subject to the
prohibition on sale would include, but not be limited to, flavored cigarettes, including menthol
cigarettes, flavored cigars, flavored smokeless tobacco, flavored shisha, and flavored nicotine
solutions that are used in electronic cigarettes.

The ordinance defines a flavored tobacco product as a tobacco product that contains a
constituent that imparts a characterizing flavor. The ordinance would create a presumption
that a tobacco product is flavored if the tobacco manufacturer makes a statement or claim that
the product has a characterizing flavor. For example, if the packaging in which a tobacco
product is sold is printed with the word “grape” or with an image of grapes, the tobacco
product would be presumed to be flavored, and subject to the restriction on sale.

Violation of the ordinance would be punishable by a suspension of the retailer’s tobacco
license
