The City and County of San Francisco (“City”) does not provide legal representation to San
Francisco tenants who face eviction from their homes. The City does fund nonprofit
organizations that provide free legal representation to some San Francisco tenants who face
eviction.

Before a landlord may evict a tenant the landlord must give the tenant a written notice that the
landlord intends to do so. If a tenant does not move after receiving that eviction notice, then the
landlord may file a lawsuit asking a court to order eviction.

Each year the Board of Supervisors adopts a budget that sets the funding for all City programs.

The Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development administers City programs to
create and preserve affordable housing in San Francisco.

This measure would require the City to establish, fund and run a program to provide legal
representation for all residential tenants in San Francisco whose landlords are attempting to evict
them from where they live.

The measure would require the City to provide a lawyer for a tenant within 30 days after the
tenant receives an eviction notice or a lawsuit seeking eviction. The lawyer would provide legal
representation to the tenant until the notice is withdrawn or the lawsuit is resolved. The measure
would not require the City to provide legal representation to tenants who reside in the same
dwelling unit with their landlord.

The measure would require the Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development to
implement this program within 12 months after the measure becomes effective.

Also, this measure would adopt a policy that, “San Francisco tenants facing an eviction from
their home shall have a right to legal representation in eviction proceedings and the City and
County shall provide such legal representation to tenants to assist in the fair administration of
justice.”
